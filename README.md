# http-server

basic http protocol from scratch using net package

This is a project I built after completing ["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) from ["codecrafters"](https://codecrafters.io/)

## How to Run This Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h0dy/http-server.git
cd http-server
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Build the Project (optional)

```bash
go build
```

or

```bash
go install
```

### 4. Run the project

if you compile the project you can just simply run the binary file

```bash
./http-server
```

Or, run it directly without building:

```bash
go run .
```
